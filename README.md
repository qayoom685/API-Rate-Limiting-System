# API-Rate-Limiting-System

The API Rate Limiting System strengthens backend security by controlling how many requests each user or IP can make within a given time frame. Built with Node.js and express-rate-limit, it prevents API abuse, protects against excessive traffic, and reduces the risk of DDoS attacks. This ensures stable, secure, and predictable API performance.
